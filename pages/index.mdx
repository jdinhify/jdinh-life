Hi there 👋

I'm JD, a web developer, currently buiding web stuff with JavaScript.

This is my personal site where I drop notes about things that I am interested in. Those can include my thoughts about the tech I'm using, introductions to tech that I think would be of interest to others, or just some tricks that I dicover in my job. While the notes reflect my opinions at the time of writing, things will inevitably change so they could be completely different from mine at present.

I also share [the tools I use](/uses) in case you're curious.

If you'd like to get in touch with me 💬, I'm on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jdinhify) and [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/jdinhify).

If you like something you read here, please feel free to share it and let me know 🙏. I'm open for discussions too 🙌.
