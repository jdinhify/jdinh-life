A simple replace regular expression to remove adjacent duplicated characters from a given string in js

```js
string.replace(/(.)(?=\\1)/g, '')
```

For example

```js
var string = 'aaaaaaaaaabccccccccccccccccccccdedfgh    ijjjjjjjjjjkkkkkkll'
var processed = string.replace(/(.)(?=\1)/g, '')

// processed is 'abcdedfgh ijkl'
```

Explanation:

- (.) : match one single character and capture it to `group 1`
- (?=\1) : positive look ahead, to match the results of `group 1` above, and not including the `group 1` in the results
- /g : interate through the whole string
