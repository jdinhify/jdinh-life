Hi there 👋

I'm JD, a web developer, currently interested in all things JavaScript.

This is my personal site where I drop notes about things that I am interested in. Those can include my thoughts about the current tech I'm using, introductions to tech that I think would be of interest to others, or just some tech tricks that I dicover in my job. While the notes reflected my opinions at the time of writing, things will inevitably change so they could be completely different from mine at present.

If you'd like to get in touch with me 💬, I'm on [twitter](https://twitter.com/jdinhify) and [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/jdinhify).

If you like something you read here, please feel free to share it and let me know 🙏.
